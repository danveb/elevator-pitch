// Elevator Pitch 

Hi, my name is Daniel Ezequiel Bae and I have 5 years experience working for an multinational trading (import/export) company with emphasis in steel and plastics for Asia, North and South America. 

Currently I am a Software Engineering student at Springboard and I want to transition to a software engineering role where I can use my full-stack developer skills to deliver innovative and creative solutions to everyday problems. 

I would love to explore new opportunities to grow in the tech industry.
